<h2>SeguraChain is experimental, do not use it like he is, until the stable release is complete and available.</h2>

Summary: SeguraChain (Secured Chain translated from Spanish) is a technology developed mainly in C#,
it allows to easily create and understand a decentralized blockchain process, it can be configured to support a sovereign update system,
allowing to include updates on it without editing the content of the Blockchain. 

Please read the whitepaper document, the document is not yet complete but most of important details are actually written.

Once the whitepaper is complete, I will make the translation of this one into english.

Everything has been developed in C#, and support Net5, a downgrade to NetFramework 4.8 is available.

<b>Visual Studio 2019 16 at minimum is required.</b>
